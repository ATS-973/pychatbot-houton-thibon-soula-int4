# Python project EFREI 2023

(By HOUTON Gaby and THIBON-SOULA Achille)

This is our semestrial python project. It consist in a ChatBot that analyses french presidents' speeches.

Link to the project: https://github.com/ATS-973/pychatbot-houton-thibon-soula-int4

So far, our ChatBot is able to fully analyses txt files and to deduce which words are important and which ones are not. It is also able to get the mot repeated words for a given president and to find which presidents talked about a given word and which one talked the most about it. It can display this informations threw a commande-line menu and have another option that allowed him to answers questions that the user asked in its own words (not very accurate yet)

To use our chatBot:

**Download and run the projet:  **
